3. Free Cash Flow & Net Present Value
Free cash flow: cash that is available to be distributed after major capital projects

FCF = Operating cash flow - capex (Cash expenditure)

Operating cash flow = EBIT - Taxes + D&A(Deprecated and amortization, non-cash item) - Change in net working capital

Capex = investment in PP&E
